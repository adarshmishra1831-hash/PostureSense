PostureSense: Smart Exercise Posture Detection
PostureSense is an AI-powered system that analyzes human exercise posture from uploaded videos.
It uses MediaPipe to extract body landmarks, applies a machine learning model to classify posture, and provides analytics through an R-based dashboard.

🧠 Key Features
1.Upload any exercise video via Streamlit
2.Extract 33 MediaPipe landmarks per frame
3.Classify each frame as Correct or Incorrect posture
4.Save predictions in a CSV file
5.Visualize results using an R Shiny dashboard

🔧 How to Run the Python App
1. Navigate to the Python Folder
cd python_app

2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start Streamlit App
streamlit run app.py

Your browser will open automatically.
Upload any exercise video and the system will generate results.csv.

📊 How to Run the R Dashboard
1. Navigate to the R Dashboard
cd r_dashboard
2. Open R or RStudio
Run:
library(shiny)
runApp("app.R")
The dashboard will load and visualize results.csv (generated by Python app).

📄 Sample Output (results.csv)
frame	posture_prediction
1	Correct
2	Incorrect
3	Correct
📦 Technologies Used
1.Python
2.Streamlit
