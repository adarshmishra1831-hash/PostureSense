# PostureSense
PostureSense analyzes exercise posture from uploaded videos using MediaPipe landmarks and an ML model to classify frames as correct or incorrect. It provides accuracy scores through a Streamlit interface and stores results in CSV files, which are visualized in an R Shiny dashboard for progress tracking.
